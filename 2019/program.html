<h3 id="keynote-1-air-quality-modelling-and-the-need-for-super-computing">Keynote 1: Air Quality Modelling and the Need for Super-Computing</h3>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Models have become a powerful tool in air quality management with a variety of applications including air quality forecast and assessment, evaluation of impacts from potential new emission sources, source contribution to high pollutant levels and the evaluation of air quality for different policy scenarios. These models estimate air pollutant concentrations for gas and aerosol species by solving the mass balance of a given compound, considering all the physical and chemical processes affecting its concentration. These processes include transport, vertical mixing, chemistry, dry and wet deposition, emissions, gas-particle conversion processes and other processes affecting aerosol growth. Air quality models are applied at different scales, from global to urban. The spatial domain is divided into grid cells and the mass balance is solved for each of them. The computing requirements increase therefore with the number of cells. Finer resolutions have been traditionally limited to small domains, but the increase in supercomputing capacity permits the simulation of larger areas at finer resolutions.</p>
